This is a repository for a breakable toy project to teach myself Clean Architecture, programming patterns like (CQRS, Value Object, Dependency Injection, Mediator Pattern, etc ...) and various technologies/NuGets like (Automapper, MediatR, Entity Framework Core, GitHub etc...).

It is still in heavy Development and might thow errors in certain areas. 

All code is heavly based on https://github.com/jasontaylordev/CleanArchitecture. Which is a wonderfull template and explanation of everything mentioned above.

In general I want to create the backend and access for a database that stores recipes. So the recipes could be accessed or changed from a console window, Blazor website or any other Gui.  

Suggestions and constructive criticism are allways welcome.

Very first version of a database. It's kept simple to reduce complexity but it should not be a problem to expand at a later point in time.
