# Ederia
This is a repository for a private project to teach myself Clean Architecture, programming patterns like (Value Object, Dependency Injection, Mediator Pattern ...) and various technologies/NuGets like (Automapper, MediatR, Entity Framework Core ...).

All code is heavly based on https://github.com/jasontaylordev/CleanArchitecture. 

In general i want to create the backend for a recipe storage. So the recipes could be accessed or changed from a console window, Blazor website or any other Gui.  

Suggestions and constructive criticism are allways welcome. 


Very first version of a database. It's kept simple to reduce complexity but it should not be a problem to expand at a later point in time.
